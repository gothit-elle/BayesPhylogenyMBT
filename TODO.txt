generate loads of tests and calculate statistics
- maybe do element wise derivatives for kolgolmorv backwards like in sophies phd thesis

sophies paper with mark on EM algorithm to compare MBT models <-- very important
plot time until extinction curves. 

update high level overview

future work mention limitations

update details so that the exact simulation process is in there, ina new section

 

double check the MCMC convergence ---> fuck.



is there a distance metric that includes tree branch lengths? look into it

such as: kendall-colijn metric

 

do frequency instead of density on rf distance hist plot


look at beast paper and see how they test it
 

need some sort of argument that it is worthwhile to use the MBT process over other models, such as LBD


run the chains, compare likelihoods (best likelihood) and rf distances

AIC to compare -- and robinson foulds


plan a time for a meeting in two weeks. can be before 9:30 -- late afternoon early evening -- eg 6pm here.

 

in theorem four, explain the relation between the kroncker product and the branching- can just expand elementwise -- all the kp means is just indep of branching processes

 

start drafting discussion session -- summarise for myself what ive done.

 

feel free to meet with sophie alone.
